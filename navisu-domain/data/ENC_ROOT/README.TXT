PRIMAR STAVANGER DISCLAIMER TEXT

PRIMAR STAVANGER has made all reasonable efforts to ensure that ENC data contained in the service supplied under this agreement is accurate. The ENC data is supplied by national Hydrographic Offices, which are responsible for the accuracy of their own chart information. 
Moreover, PRIMAR STAVANGER shall not be liable (except in case of death or personal injury solely and directly attributable to any negligent compilation or transcription by PRIMAR STAVANGER) in contract, tort, under statute or otherwise.

The ENCs contained in the Primar Stavanger service meet SOLAS chart carriage requirements when kept up to date and used on an ECDIS with suitable backup.



DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF ECDIS

Considerable progress has been made in the development of Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems (ECDIS), the navigational systems which make use of ENC data.  Many are being developed and a number have now achieved type approval.  Mariners should be aware of the significant changes in navigational practice required by the introduction of ECDIS, and of the need to manage these changes in a careful and prudent manner.  It should also be noted that the appearance and content of the data displayed in electronic charts may differ substantially from the same or similar data in the paper chart form.

Because of the developing nature of ECDIS and because there is as yet only limited ENC data availability, there has so far been little experience of the practical, operational use of ECDIS.  Mariners must therefore be aware of the user training requirement.  They should satisfy themselves that their ECDIS provides all the navigational functionality that they will need, and that they are familiar with the operation of this functionality.  For example, some early ECDIS systems may be unable to display the cautionary notes which appear on the paper chart and are included in the ENC.  Hence, care is required while experience is gained in the practical use of ECDIS.  Some national maritime administrations have issued advice relating to the introduction of ECDIS, and mariners should ensure that they are aware of, and conversant with, that advice.



HYDROGRAPHIC OFFICES´ INFORMATION


AU (Australia)

UPDATES

Updates for Australian ENCs are issued in line with the fortnightly paper Australian Notices to Mariners booklet.  ENC updates are issued for all Permanent Notices to Mariners.  For details of Temporary and Preliminary Notices to Mariners, mariners should consult the paper fortnightly Australian Notices to Mariners booklet or the AHS website at www.hydro.gov.au or register online at the AHS website to receive eNotices, an email Notices to Mariners service.

DATA APPEARANCE

It should be noted that the appearance and content of Australian ENCS may differ substantially from the same or similar data in the paper chart form.  In particular the compulsory pilotage routes in the Great Barrier Reef contain depth data at 1-metre contour intervals taken from original surveys rather than from the existing paper charts. This will enable the full benefits of ECDIS and particularly its safety depth alarm function to be used most effectively.

IMPORTANT NOTICE

Australian ENCs include all significant hydrographic information obtained by the Australian 
Hydrographic Service (AHS) at date of compilation.  Significant information is updated by 
Australian Notices to Mariners.  All reasonable efforts have been made to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information, including third party information, incorporated in this product.  The AHS regards third parties from which it receives information as reliable, however the AHS cannot verify all such information and errors may therefore exist.  Where possible, indications regarding the reliability of information are noted or symbolised in the product. Users should familiarise themselves with the meaning of any notes or symbols.  The AHS does not accept liability for errors in third party information or the inappropriate use of Australian ENCs.

According to the SOLAS convention (IMO Marine Safety Committee Resolution 99(73) which came 
into force July 1st 2002) this official Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC) produced by the Finnish 
Maritime Administration (FMA) can be used as a primary chart when there are no larger scale chart 
data available and the mariner is using a type approved ECDIS system.

This ENC is based on paper charts and is published by the FMA. There are several ENC?s available for 
the Finnish coast. For the latest ENC coverage of Finnish waters, please contact your local ENC 
distributor.

Paper charts on a scale of 1:50000 are available for the Finnish coast. Additionally there are larger scale 
paper charts available for most important ports (Hamina (Finnish chart # 134), Kotka (# 138), Helsinki 
(# 191), Hanko (# 136), Turku (# 190), Maarianhamina (# 160), Degerby (# 169) and Mäntyluoto (# 
225). 

In the table below you will find the paper equivalents of Finnish ENC cells according to their usage 
band.

ENC Usage band		Paper Chart product

General (2)		General charts (scales 1:100000 - 1:500000, charts # 901,# 902,# 903 etc.)

ELECTRONIC NAVIGATIONAL CHARTS - Cautionary guidance on the use and 
limitations of ENCs and associated ECDIS systems.

Attention is drawn to the statement in Chapter 1, sections 1.1 and 1.2 of 
The Mariners Handbook (NP100) concerning the use of navigational 
information provided by the UKHO. This includes the following caution which 
applies to all charts, paper and electronic:

     While the UKHO has made all reasonable efforts to ensure the data 
     supplied is accurate, it should be appreciated that the data may 
     not always be complete, up to date or positioned to modern 
     surveying standards and therefore no warranty can be given as to 
     its accuracy. The mariner must be the final judge of the reliance 
     he places on the information given, bearing in mind his particular 
     circumstances, the needs of safe and prudent navigation, local 
     pilotage guidance and the judicious use of available navigational 
     aids.

Updates for UKHO ENCs are issued weekly in line with UKHO policy for all 
its navigational charts, paper and electronic. Due to unforeseen technical 
difficulties, ENC updates may occasionally be issued late and consequently 
may not be synchronised with the corresponding Notices to Mariners and 
updates for paper and ARCS charts. Updates are issued for all Permanent 
Chart-Correcting and Preliminary Notices to Mariners. However, it may not 
always be possible to issue updates for Temporary Notices to Mariners, 
especially those that cover large geographical areas and are not chart 
specific. Mariners should consult the paper weekly Notices to Mariners 
booklet or the UKHO website, www.nms.ukho.gov.uk, for details of these 
Notices to Mariners. 

Considerable progress has been made in the development of Electronic Chart 
Display and Information Systems (ECDIS), the navigational systems which 
make use of ENC data. Many are being developed and a number have now 
achieved type approval. Mariners should be aware of the significant changes 
in navigational practice required by the introduction of ECDIS and of the 
need to manage these changes in a careful and prudent manner.

It should also be noted that the appearance and content of the data 
displayed in electronic charts may differ substantially from the same or 
similar data in the paper chart form. The definition of an ENC permits them 
to include information contained in nautical publications. However, 
currently-available ENCs do not contain such information and mariners using 
ENCs must continue to use related Admiralty nautical publications.

Because of the developing nature of ECDIS and because there is as yet only 
limited ENC data availability, there has so far been little experience of 
the practical, operational use of ECDIS. Mariners must therefore be aware 
of the user training requirement. They should satisfy themselves that their 
ECDIS provides all the navigational functionality that they will need and 
that they are familiar with the operation of this functionality. For 
example, some early ECDIS systems may be unable to display the cautionary 
notes which appear on the paper chart and are included in the ENC. Hence, 
care is required while experience is gained in the practical use of ECDIS. 
Some national maritime administrations have issued advice relating to the 
introduction of ECDIS, and mariners should ensure that they are aware of, 
and conversant with, that advice.
